            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my food blog where I post about the restaurants I have visited and subsequently the meals I
                found the most delicious.</p>
            <p>For today's post I will be focusing on several locations found around the Petty Building of UNCG,
                specifically places within a half mile.</p>
            <p>Our three locations today will feature a pizza place and a seperate wing place to match, along with a
                pita place to add variaty.</p>
            <p>Please feel free to visit any of these places and try any of the meals featured here or branch out on
                your own.</p>

                <p>Slices pizza co. is a wonderful pizza shop whose main feature lay in selling pizza's by the slice.
                    While there are other options such as pastas and deserts I definitely recommend digging in with some
                    of their very generous slices of pizza.</p>

                <p>Pita Delite is a new personal discovery of mine as I had never been to a pita place before. The
                    experience has been very new and unique for me and while I cant yet speak for everything on the menu
                    the bowls of kabobs have been wonderful.</p>
